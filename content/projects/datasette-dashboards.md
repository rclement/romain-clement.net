## Pitch

I like Datasette but there is no built-in dashboard feature.

I like Metabase but it is heavy to deploy and users/dashboards/charts cannot be
defined from a static configuration.

Let's bringing beautiful Business Intelligence dashboards to Datasette!

## Accolades

!!! quote
    Romain Clementâ€™s datasette-dashboards plugin lets you configure dashboards for Datasette using YAML, combining markdown blocks, Vega graphs and single number metrics using a layout powered by CSS grids. This is a beautiful piece of software design, with a very compelling live demo.
