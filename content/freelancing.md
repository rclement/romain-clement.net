# Freelancing

## About

My current domains of interest and expertise include:

- Data engineering
- Data science and machine learning engineering
- DevOps and MLOps (CI/CD)
- [Privacy by design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design)
- [End-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption)
- [Active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning)

## Technical Stack

- [x] Python
- [x] Flask
- [x] FastAPI
- [x] Pytest
- [x] Scikit-Learn
- [x] Tensorflow / Keras
- [x] PyTorch / Fast.ai
- [x] SQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite
- [x] Datasette
- [x] Metabase

My favorite technical stacks include Python, Node.js, TypeScript, Nuxt.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, GitLab-CI, GitHub Actions. And I am currently exploring the brave new world of Rust!

I am not the right man for the job if you are looking for webdesign, CMS-based monolith websites (Wordpress, Drupal, etc.), PHP, develop massive user-data aggregation systems, privacy-invasive systems.

## Contracts

Since 2012, I've been working with various companies. I believe in building software with privacy in mind from the ground-up: this is something we can choose willingly from the start, empowering businesses to find their true added value. Designing privacy-friendly systems goes hand in hand with transparency and security. I am currently accepting new contracts.

    I am currently under contract with several companies.
    However, I am always open to new opportunities and challenges
    so feel free to contact me!
