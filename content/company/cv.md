Idea:
- use YAML frontmatter metadata for sections
- use specific cv jinja2 template (might require css print media queries for good printing)
- add print link in template
- auto-generate PDF on CI? (might not be necessary)

I started my own freelancing company in 2018 with a strong focus on bringing software engineering skills for data and artifical intelligence applications, as well as teaching.

My current domains of expertise and interest include:

- Software and data engineering
- Data science and machine learning engineering
- Quality assurance processes, DevOps and MLOps
- Active learning teaching

When collaborating with companies, I strive to deliver lean and pragmatic solutions in iterative cycles, in order to develop products with strong added value.

I am also the organizer of the Meetup Python Grenoble, monthly meeting of the alpine Python community.

Interested to work together? Let's talk!
