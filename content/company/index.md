# Company

I started my own freelancing company in 2018 with a strong focus on bringing
software engineering skills for data and artifical intelligence applications,
as well as teaching others.

My current domains of expertise and interest include:

- Software and data engineering
- [Data science][data-science] and [machine learning][machine-learning] engineering
- Quality assurance processes, [DevOps][devops] and [MLOps][mlops]
- [Active learning][active-learning] teaching

When collaborating with companies, I strive to deliver lean and pragmatic solutions
in iterative cycles, in order to develop products with strong added value.
