Software and data goes hand in hand, but insuring quality for automated data
processes is key. I usually advocate for simple and lean processes whenever
possible, encouraging the use of quality small data instead of big data.

I can help your team grow by building data pipelines (ETL, ELT) and backend
services (REST APIs).

Artificial intelligence and data science has been all the rage for a few years now.
However, lots of companies are still struggling to put their machine learning
models in production. I can help getting started to automate learning pipelines
and integrating models into applications.

I can help your data science teams to implement best practices into their workflow
to deliver reproducible data analysis and reporting.

## Technical Training

!!! quote "Frank Oppenheimer"
    The best way to learn is to teach.

Whether it is new-comers or experienced practitioners, there is always something
new to be learned. I like to share my experience and knowledge with others by
using active learning teaching methologies: learners are front and center and
are building their skillset from top to bottom, applying the concepts right away.

Currently offered training topics:

- [x] Software Engineering
- [x] Data Engineering / Science / Analysis
- [x] Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
