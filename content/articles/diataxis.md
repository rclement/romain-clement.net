Today I learn of [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr), a framework to write
documentation by using a 4 layers approach:

- Tutorials
- How-to guides
- Explanation
- Reference

Most of this is oriented around product documentation but a lot of things
resonate with education. I've already naturally explored some of the ideas
(especially with "top-to-bottom" combined with "big-picture" approach for
tutorials) but this framework is formalizing so much more things.

Lots of organizations and projects known for their top-notch documentation
are already using it: [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com),
[Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/),
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/), etc.
