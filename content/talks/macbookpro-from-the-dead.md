# Bringing my MacBook Pro from the Dead

Lightning talk given on September 25th, 2024 at the [PyData Paris 2024][pydata] conference.

## Summary

...or "My right to repair a MacBook Pro!"

My MacBook Pro 2015 has served me well for the last 7 years. However, recently a number of hardware faults have cropped up the device, to the point of not being really usable anymore. As I believe in repairing everyday tools, I went on a quest to bring it back from the dead!

This lightning talk is a review with a humourous take on what it takes to try to repair a laptop with hard-to-fix components. It should be the mandatory warning information hardware vendor should provide to customers when buying their products!
