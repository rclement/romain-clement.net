# Hey Claude, generate me a lightning talk, right now!

Improvised lightning talk given on October 1st, 2025 at the [PyData Paris 2025][pydata] conference.

## Summary

By 2025, we've been promised a 10x productivity improvement by using AI coding agents, let's put that to the test: usually it takes me between 30 minutes and an hour to prepare a lightning talk, so I should expect to be able to improvise building a lightning talk right now using Anthropic Claude Code, and still have time to present it! Let's do it!

**Disclaimer**: this is a fun take on the hype around coding agents in the form of a funny and improvised lightning talk, don't take it personally!
